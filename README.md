## Proposal

#### A generative 3d flower sitting on a plane

##### the petals of the flower will be made up of stacked shapes each with alternating rotations. (The rotations will be generated using quaterninions). Biggest shape at the bottom and smallest at the top. 

##### the petals will be sitting on stems percedurally generated in a fractal formation. 

##### an example of one of the petals is shown in the following video:
